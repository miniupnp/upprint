ChangeLog

upprint v1.7 2012/03/27
	(2012/02/18) PS1 - lprwrap: test for $LPR after reading --lpr.
	(2012/02/18) PS1 - lprwrap: changed the way the name of the "real"
	lpr program is determined when LPR is not set. Now we first check
	whether "lpr" actually refers to the lprwrap script. If yes, use
	"lpr-orig" as the backend, else use "lpr". Reason: now users can do
	"alias lpr=lprwrap". This is better than the old method (making
	/usr/bin/lpr a symbolic	link to /usr/bin/lprwrap), because
	distributions tend to overwrite /usr/bin/lpr on each update.
	(2011/08/01) PS1 - lprwrap: pass unrecognized -o options to the
	underlying lpr, so that applications expecting a CUPS lpr will
	still work.

upprint v1.6 2011/07/23
	(2011/07/22) PS1 - psdim: compensate for certain PostScript files
	generated by Acrobat Reader that anchor the page on the top left
	corner instead of the bottom left corner of the page device.
	Reported by Tom Loredo.
	(2011/01/04) PS1 - lprwrap: added size limit on text files, and
	an option --force to override it
	(2011/01/04) PS1 - lprwrap: removed literal control characters
	from regular expression
	(2010/01/06) PS1 - psdim: added options --[lrtb]adjust for
	adjusting bounding box of input document. Based on a patch by
	Paulus Esterhazy (PE1).
	(2009/03/12) PS1 - lprwrap: added support for pdftops as a better
	alternative to pdf2ps.
	(2008/12/13) PS1 - psdim: when compiled with metric defaults, use
	metric units in the output format string.
	(2008/09/09) PS1 - lprwrap: added -c option to iconv.
	(2008/08/14) PS1 - lprwrap: allow multiple -ofudge options.
	(2008/05/11) PS1 - lprwrap: declare temporary variables locally.
	(2008/05/11) PS1 - lprwrap: allow tray1, tray2, tray3, manualfeed
	as aliases for upper, middle, lower, manual.
	(2008/05/11) PS1 - lprwrap: eliminated separate lprwrap-features
	script.
	(2008/05/10) PS1 - lprwrap: print multiple non-collated copies by
	sending multiple print jobs; avoid backend -#n option, which does
	not work for duplexing when there is an odd number of pages
	(otherwise some CUPS versions print the first page of the second
	copy on back of the last page of the first copy).
	(2008/05/10) PS1 - lprwrap: after setting duplexing, tray, paper,
	and collation options, disable setpagedevice to prevent print
	spoolers, such as CUPS, from imposing their own defaults on the
	already formatted PostScript file. Note: this does not really
	work.
	(2008/05/01) PS1 - lprwrap: removed obsolete lprwrap-cups script.
	When upgrading, the script is replaced by a symbolic link for
	backward compatibility.
	(2008/05/01) PS1 - lprwrap: added -ocups option to delegate
	duplexing, tray and paper selection and collation to CUPS instead
	of handling it in the frontend.
	(2008/05/01) PS1 - lprwrap: respect the TEMPDIR environment
	variable if set.
	(2007/12/04) PS1 - lprwrap: added new-style duplex and media
	options to cups backend.
	(2007/12/04) PS1 - lprwrap: added --lpr option to specify backend
	executable.
	(2007/03/23) PS1 - portability: added autoconf test for ceil().
	Reported by Xiaoyong Guo.

	a single new package.
	(2005/09/25) PS1 - psdim: added fudge feature to allow a certain
	percentage of pixels to lie outside text boundaries.
	(2005/09/25) PS1 - psdim: added --clip option to generate page
	clipping information, which can be used by a specially patched
	version of pstops.

lpr-wrapper v0.7 2007/01/22
	(2006/12/23) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: added support for Unicode text
	files via iconv

	(2005/08/03) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: added lpr-wrapper-cups.

	check
	(2005/08/01) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: replaced PPD file mechanism by a

	messed up the internal structure of some PostScript files.
	(2005/08/01) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: removed "-l" option from backend
	to allow CUPS to format output for non-postscript printers.

psdim v1.4 2005/03/30

	gcc 3.

lpr-wrapper v0.6 2004/01/15
	(2004/01/15) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: treat unknown file types as text
	if they contain no unprintable characters
	(2003/12/11) PS1 - lpr-wrapper: added "-l" option to lpr-orig,
	which triggers "raw" mode in CUPS, preventing CUPS filters from
	messing with our pre-formatted data. For BSD lpr, the "-l" option
	does no harm.

lpr-wrapper v0.4 2004/12/06
