.SH NAME
lprwrap \- enhanced lpr with options for duplexing and n-up printing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B lprwrap [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfile\fP]...
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlprwrap\fP is a wrapper around the standard \fBlpr\fP program that
performs client-side pre-processing of print jobs. It recognizes
special options for duplex printing and n-up printing, and can be used
as a drop-in replacement for a BSD compatible \fBlpr\fP.  
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Options specific to \fBlprwrap\fP:
.TP 11
.B    --help             
Print usage information and exit.
.TP
.B    --version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B    --verbose
Print some diagnostics to stderr.
.TP
.B    --test             
Send output to stdout instead of printer.
.TP
.B    --force
Force printing of long text files. Usually the size of text files is
limited to 16000 characters, to prevent paper waste from non-text
files accidentally printed as text. This option lifts this limit.
.TP
.B    --tmpdir \fIdir\fP
Set directory for temporary files.
.TP
.B    --lpr \fIname\fP
Program to use for the backend \fBlpr\fP. Default: \fBlpr\fP. An
exception is when \fBlpr\fP is a name for the \fBlprwrap\fP script
itself (for example, a symbolic link); in this case, we use
\fBlpr-orig\fP as the default name of the backend.
.TP
.B    -oduplex, -od      
Duplex printing (with long edge binding).  Note that \fB-oduplex\fP
and \fB-ohduplex\fP refer to whether you turn the page on the long
edge or on the short edge, with respect to the \fIinput\fP page. That
is, if you select \fB-o2up\fP, you should still select \fB-oduplex\fP,
just as you would if you hadn\(cqt selected \fB-o2up\fP.  But if your
input file is in landscape format, you should probably select
\fB-ohduplex\fP.
.TP
.B    -ohduplex, -oh     
Duplex printing (with short edge binding). See also \fB-oduplex\fP.
.TP
.B    -osimplex, -os     
No duplex printing (default).
.TP
.B    -o\fIpaper\fP
Select a paper size: letter, executive, legal, a3, a4, a5, b5,
tabloid, statement, folio, quarto, 10x14.  (default is @DEFAULT_FORMAT@).
.TP
.B    -o\fItray\fP
Select a tray: upper, middle, lower, manual.
.TP
.B    -o2up              
2-up printing.
.TP
.B    -o4up              
4-up printing.
.TP
.B    -o8up              
8-up printing.
.TP
.B    -o9up              
9-up printing.
.TP
.B    -o16up             
16-up printing.
.TP
.B    -odumb             
Faster, but uglier n-up printing (don\(cqt fit to size).
.TP
.B    -osolid
Handle non-white background colors. Normally, when calculating the
bounding box of a document, \fBlprwrap\fP assumes that the background
(i.e., the margins) are white. With the -osolid option, solidly
colored backgrounds are handled correctly, at the expense of much
slower execution. Patterned backgrounds are not currently supported.
.TP
.B -ofudge=\fR[\fIL\fP|\fIR\fP|\fIT\fP|\fIB\fP]\fP\fIn\fP
Set the percentage of pixels that are allowed out of bounds. The
default is 0. When calculating the bounding box of a document, a small
amount of text or pixels protruding into the margins can mess up the
computation. The \fB-ofudge\fP option makes the bounding box slightly
smaller by allowing a percentage of the pixels to be outside the
bounding box. This threshold can be set separately for the left (L),
right (R), top (T), and bottom (B) margins. 

Note that \fB-ofudge=20\fP is equivalent to \fB-ofudge=LRTB20\fP. This
means 20 percent of the pixels are allowed to be in \fIeach\fP of the left,
right, top, and bottom margins. Therefore up to 80 (and not 20)
percent of the pixels can be outside the bounding box.
.TP
.B    -ofit              
Fit to size in 1-up mode.
.TP
.B    -obox
Print a box around each page (plain text only).
.TP
.B    -oinfo
Print date and user name on each page (plain text only).
.TP
.B    -ouncollated       
With -#, make \fInum\fP copies of each page, not of each file.
.TP
.B    -ocups
Let CUPS handle duplexing, paper and tray selection, and collation.
The (preferable) default behavior is to handle these features in the
frontend and encode them as PostScript instructions. There is no need
to use this option unless your version of CUPS (probably an older
version) is having trouble with handling the above features; in this
case, specifying \fB-ocups\fP option might solve the problem.
.PD
.SS Standard \fBlpr\fP options:
The following standard \fBlpr\fP options are also supported:  
.TP 11
.B    -P \fIprinter\fP         
Direct output to a specific printer.
.TP
.B    -h                 
Do not print burst page.
.TP
.B    -m                 
Send mail upon completion.
.TP
.B    -r                 
Remove the file upon completion of spooling.
.TP
.B    -# \fInum\fP
Number of copies to make of each file.
.TP
.B    -[1234] \fIfont\fP       
Specify a font to be mounted on font position 1\-4.
.TP
.B    -C \fIclass\fP           
Job classification to use on the burst page.
.TP
.B    -J \fIjob\fP
Job name to print on the burst page.
.TP
.B    -U \fIuser\fP            

User name to print on the burst page and for accounting.  This option
is only honored if the real user-id is \fBdaemon\fP (or that specified
in the printcap file instead of \fBdaemon\fP), and is intended for
those instances where print filters wish to requeue jobs.
.PD
.SS Ignored options:
The following options are ignored for backwards compatibility:
  
.B    -T \fItitle\fP, -i \fInumcols\fP, -w \fInum\fP, -c, -d, -f, -g, -l, -n, -p, -t, -v, -s.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Command line options are also read from the two files \fI/etc/lprrc\fP
and \fI$HOME/.lprrc\fP, if they exist, and processed in that order
before any other command line options are processed. For instance, if
you like duplex printing to be your default, put \(dq\fB\-od\fP\(dq
into one of these files, or if you would like to use a private temp
directory, put \(dq\fB--tmpdir\fP \fItmpdir\fP\(dq. You can also use this
to set the default paper size.

.SH EXIT STATUS
On successful completion, 0 is returned, otherwise a positive error number.
