.SH NAME
@PSDIM@ \- calculate optimal page format for n-up printing from a
postscript file 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PSDIM@ [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIfilename\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@PSDIM@\fP is a small utility to be used in conjunction with
\fBpstops\fP.  It looks at the contents of a postscript document to
determine the size of the printed pages. From this, it
calculates the optimal placement of the pages for n-up printing. It
outputs a format string suitable for processing by \fBpstops\fP.

In order to determine the size of the pages in a postscript document
accurately, \fB@PSDIM@\fP uses the ghostscript interpreter to render
the document. For this reason, \fB@PSDIM@\fP is relatively slow, but
yields very accurate results that could not be obtained by just
naively looking at the postscript headers. For \fB@PSDIM@\fP to work,
\fBgs\fP must be installed on your system.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP 11
.B -h, --help
Print usage information and exit.
.TP
.B -v, --version
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B -l, --license
Print license information and exit.
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Suppress printing progress information. Normally, \fB@PSDIM@\fP prints
page numbers to stderr for each page processed.
.TP
.B -x, --width \fIdim\fP
Specify the physical width of the output paper. 
.TP
.B -y, --height \fIdim\fP
Specify the physical height of the output paper.
.TP
.B -p, --page \fIformat\fP
Specify the format of the output paper: one of a4, a3, a5, b5, letter,
legal, tabloid, statement, executive, folio, quarto, 10x14. The
default is @DEFAULT_FORMAT@. Paper formats are case insensitive. The \fB-p\fP
option is equivalent to a corresponding pair or \fB-x\fP and \fB-y\fP
options.
.TP
.B -m, --margin \fIdim\fP
Set the width of the margins between the document and the edge of the
paper.  The default is 0.5in.
.TP
.B -n, --hmargin \fIdim\fP
Like \fB-m\fP, but only set the horizontal (left and right) margins.
.TP
.B -o, --vmargin \fIdim\fP
Like \fB-m\fP, but only set the vertical (top and bottom) margins.
.TP
.B -s, --sep \fIdim\fP
Set the width of the white space separating input pages when they are
combined on a single output page.  The default is 0.5in.
.TP
.B -t, --hsep \fIdim\fP
Like \fB-s\fP, but only set the space in the horizontal direction.
.TP
.B -u, --vsep \fIdim\fP
Like \fB-s\fP, but only set the space in the vertical direction.
.TP
.B -L, --landscape
Select the landscape orientation (pages are rotated to the left). This
is the default for 2-up and 8-up printing. Note that the printed text
is rotated, not the physical page.
.TP
.B -R, --seascape
Select the seascape orientation (pages are rotated to the right). Note
that the printed text is rotated, not the physical paper.
.TP
.B -U, --upside-down
Select the upside-down orientation.
.TP
.B -P, --portrait
Select the portrait (upright) orientation. This is the default for
4-up, 9-up, and 16-up printing.
.TP
.B -f, --format \fIn\fPx\fIm\fP
Arrange pages in \fIn\fP rows and \fIm\fP columns. 
.TP
.B -a, --hpolicy \fIn\fP
Select the horizontal alignment policy. For n=0, the horizontal
alignment of pages follows a rigid grid. For n=1, the pages in each
column are aligned, but each column is centered in its available
horizontal space. For n=2, each page is centered horizontally in its
column. n=3,4 behave like n=1,2, except the width of the columns is
variable.
.TP
.B -b, --vpolicy \fIn\fP
Select the vertical alignment policy. For n=0, the vertical
alignment of pages follows a rigid grid. For n=1, the pages in each
row are aligned, but each row is centered in its available vertical
space. For n=2, each page is centered vertically in its row. n=3,4
behave like n=1,2, except the height of the rows is variable.
.TP
.B -c, --columnmode
Arrange the pages in columns (default is in rows). For instance, in
4-up printing, pages 1 and 2 will normally appear above pages 3 and
4. If \fB-c\fP is selected, pages 1 and 2 will appear to the left of
pages 3 and 4. 
.TP
.B -d, --righttoleft
Arrange the pages with page numbers increasing from right to left
(default is from left to right).
.TP
.B -e, --bottomtotop
Arrange the pages with page numbers increasing from bottom to top
(default is from top to bottom).
.TP
.B -C, --color
Handle colored backgrounds. This option must be given when the
document uses a background color other than white. Color processing is
significantly slower than black-and-white processing, and should only
be used when necessary. Note: while \fB@PSDIM@\fP will calculate the
correct document dimensions, \fBpstops\fP is very bad at cropping
colored backgrounds and will probably do a bad job with such documents.
.TP
.B -i, --clip
Output page clipping instructions. Some PostScript documents specify
an opaque background color, instead of leaving the background
transparent.  This happens particularly with scanned documents. In
this case, pstops often overwrites all or part of one page in 2-up
mode.  The \fB--clip\fP option solves this problem by outputting
additional page clipping instructions that can be understood by
pstops-clip.
.TP
.B -F, --fudge \fR[\fIL\fP|\fIR\fP|\fIT\fP|\fIB\fP]\fP\fIn\fP
Set the percentage of pixels that are allowed out of bounds. The
default is 0. When calculating the bounding box of a document, a small
amount of text or pixels protruding into the margins can mess up the
computation. The \fB--fudge\fP option makes the bounding box slightly
smaller by allowing a percentage of the pixels to be outside the
bounding box. This threshold can be set separately for the left (L),
right (R), top (T), and bottom (B) margins. 

Note that \fB--fudge=20\fP is equivalent to \fB--fudge=LRTB20\fP. This
means 20 percent of the pixels are allowed to be in \fIeach\fP of the left,
right, top, and bottom margins. Therefore up to 80 (and not 20)
percent of the pixels can be outside the bounding box.
.TP
.B -H, --ladjust \fIdim\fP
.TP
.B -I, --radjust \fIdim\fP
.TP
.B -J, --tadjust \fIdim\fP
.TP
.B -K, --badjust \fIdim\fP
Shrink the input document\'s bounding box by moving the respective
edge (left, right, top, bottom) by an additional amount towards the
center of the page.  This adjustment is applied after any
fudging. Sometimes it is difficult to find the correct fudge
percentage, and it is easier to just look at the document and specify
an absolute dimension. A negative argument causes the bounding box to
be enlarged instead of shrunk.

.TP
.B -S, --shrink
Only shrink, never enlarge page.
.TP
.B -1, --1up
Fit to size. Equivalent to \fB-f1x1 --portrait\fP.
.TP
.B -2, --2up
Equivalent to \fB-f1x2 --landscape\fP.
.TP
.B -4, --4up
Equivalent to \fB-f2x2 --portrait\fP.
.TP
.B -8, --8up
Equivalent to \fB-f2x4 --landscape\fP.
.TP
.B -9, --9up
Equivalent to \fB-f3x3 --portrait\fP.
.TP
.B -6, --16up
Equivalent to \fB-f4x4 --portrait\fP.
.PD
.SH OPERANDS
If a filename is given, then a postscript document is read from that
file. Otherwise, a postscript document is read from standard input.
.SH DIMENSIONS
Several command line options take a dimension argument. Dimensions can
carry one of the optional units "in", "cm", "mm", or "pt". Here, 1pt
is a postscript point, or 1/72 inches. The default unit is "@DEFAULT_UNIT@".
.SH ALIGNMENT POLICIES
In n-up printing, several input pages are rearranged into rows and
columns on a single output page. If all the input pages are of equal
width, height, and margins, then it is a straightforward task to
arrange them in a grid. However, if the input pages are of variable
width, height, and/or margins, then several choices arise regarding
their optimal placement. These choices are governed by the horizontal
and vertical \fIalignment policies\fP, which are specified by the
\fB-a\fP and \fB-b\fP options. The horizontal alignment policy affects
only the x-coordinates of the pages in the output, and the vertical
policy affects only the y-coordinates.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the simplest case, \fB@PSDIM@\fP can be used to figure out an
optimal format string for 2-up printing:
.IP
.nf
> @PSDIM@ --2up test.ps
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
2:0@0.93L(9.79in,-1.13in)+1@0.93L(9.79in,4.09in)
.fi
.LP
The resulting format string can be fed directly to \fBpstops\fP:
.IP
.nf
> pstops `@PSDIM@ --2up test.ps` test.ps test.2up.ps
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
Wrote 5 pages, 155746 bytes
.fi
.LP
.SH EXIT STATUS
On successful completion, 0 is returned, otherwise a positive error number.
